# xero-bulk-void-tool-react

## Goals

1. Rebuild my previous bulk void tool that uses express and handlebars, to a modern React web app. 
2. Learn how to authenticate with Xero using React 
3. Provide a clean interface where users can bulk void invoices

## The Idea

Although I was very happy with building a bulk invoice tool, I knew the technologies used were already outdated. For this 
reason, version two will be using React. React provides a lot of extra functionality using state, that my previous
 app doesn't have. Users will now be able to simply filter and adjust what invoices display in the table, before selecting 
 and voiding their invoices.
